            <h2>ScotBot Proof of Stake</h2>
            <p>
                Scotbot can enable mining where owning token A generates more of
                token A. If you want this to happen we need to setup a rewards
                pool for it. This will require a 1000 eng setup fee and requires
                a token that has already been created and already has staking
                enabled.
