            <h2>ScotBot Mining</h2>
            <p>
                Scotbot can enable mining where token A mines token B. In order
                to set this up we have to setup a new rewards pool.
                <br />
                So, you'll have to tell us "I want X tokens minted every n
                blocks" like "I want 10 tokens minted every 5 blocks." Keep in
                mind a block is a second. The price of 1 miner is 100 eng burned
                for the token creation.
                <br />
                1000 eng burned to make the token stakable, and 1000 eng as a
                fee to setup the rewards pool. The price of 2 miners is 200 eng
                burned for the tokens, 2000 eng to make each token stakable,
                1000 eng for the scotbot setup fee for the mining rewards pool.
