            <p>
                There's hardy a better way to give your token immediate utility
                than by creating a voting bot, powering it up with some steem,
                and letting it vote only when people send it your token!
                <br />
                <br />
                You'll want this on a new account. Something like @token.voter.
                After you set this up, you will need to give active and posting
                authority to the @postpromoter account. You can do this
                <a
                    href="https://eonwarped.github.io/steem/sk/main.html"
                    target="_blank"
                    style="text-decoration: underline;"
                    >here</a
                >.
                <br />
                <br />
                Once you have created it and staked it you have one major
                question to figure out. Any of the delegators will get a share
                of their rewards proportional to the delegation, but you'll also
                have SP that lives on the bot. The question is what should we do
                with tokens earned by organic SP?
                <br />
                <br />
                What should happen to tokens earned by organic SP?
