                    Hive Engine is a smart contracts side-chain platform for the Hive blockchain. 
                    This means that it can execute custom smart contracts based on data published to 
                    the Hive blockchain. This allows us to do things that are not currently supported 
                    by the Hive blockchain, such as creating custom tokens, or literally anything else achievable with a smart contract.

                        Hive Engine uses the Hive Smart Contracts software created by @harpagon. 
                        The software scans all blocks added to the Hive blockchain for transfers, 
                        custom_json, or even comment operations that contain a certain sidechain ID. 
                        It then executes the smart contract function specified in the operation data 
                        and packages it into a block which is added to the sidechain. It also maintains 
                        the current state of the sidechain and all smart contracts running on it which 
                        can be queried using a familiar RPC API.                                </div>

                        BEE is the native token of the Hive Engine platform, 
                        just like how ETH is the native token of the Ethereum platform. 
                        BEE is currently required to create a new token on the Hive Engine platform, 
                        and in the future it will be required to publish and execute custom smart contracts.                                </div>

                        1M BEE tokens have been set aside for initial sale at the cost 
                        of 1 HIVE per BEE token. They can be purchased through this website 
                        by clicking the "Buy BEE" button on the Tokens page. In the future, 
                        BEE will be able to be earned by running the Hive Smart Contracts node
                        software to create blocks and help secure the network, just as HIVE/BTC/ETH
                        can be earned by block producers securing their networks. At that point BEE
                        will no longer be offered for sale directly and the price will be determined
                        by the internal HIVE/BEE market.

                        The fee is primarily to prevent people from creating "spam" tokens that have no real planned use. 
                        If you would like to test creating a token, you can do so for free on the testnet website here. 
                        The fee is meant to be large enough to prevent people from creating tokens they don't plan to 
                        actually use, but small enough to not be a barrier for any serious projects. 
                        If you have a good project and you truly cannot afford the fee, please contact us 
                        on Discord and we may be able to cover the fee for you.

                            After a new token is created they must be "issued" in order for them to be used and traded. 
                            The total amount of a token that can be issued is limited by the max supply set during token creation. 
                            Tokens may be issued all at once or in small amounts over time, it is up to the token creator. 
                            To issue a token, you can click on the token in the list on the Tokens page and then click 
                            on the "Issue" button on the top right of the screen. Only the creator of the token may 
                            issue them, so you must be logged in with the Hive account that created the token in order for the option to appear.
