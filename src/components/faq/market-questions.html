                        The Hive Engine market is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that allows 
                        anyone to buy or sell any token created on the Hive Engine platform against HIVE. 
                        All transactions are published on the Hive blockchain and trades are executed by the 
                        open source Hive Smart Contracts platform software which is avaialble for anyone to 
                        independently run and verify. The Hive Engine market is very similar to other decentralized 
                        exchanges such as BitShares, Stellar, and even the internal HIVE / HBD market on the Hive blockchain.

                        Since the Hive Engine platform is not part of the core Hive blockchain code, 
                        it cannot transact in the HIVE token directly. Instead we have created a Hive 
                        Engine token which is pegged to the value of the HIVE token, called HIVEP. 
                        This means that all trading on the Hive Engine market will use the HIVEP 
                        token which can be exchanged for real HIVE or vice versa at any time on a 1:1 basis.
                        <br><br>
                        HIVEP is pegged to the value of HIVE because one HIVE token will be held for every HIVEP token in circulation, and users are able to exchange HIVE for HIVEP and vice versa on a 1:1 basis at any time. This is the same way that many other pegged tokens work, such as Tether where, allegedly, $1 is held for every USDT token in circulation. Unlike with Tether, anyone can easily verify that the amount of HIVE held in the @steem-peg account is enough to cover all of the HIVEP tokens in circulation at any time thanks to the open and transparent nature of the Hive blockchain. Another example of creating a HIVE-pegged token to allow HIVE to be traded on another exchange is the Hive Anchor project which allows HIVE and HBD to be traded on the Stellar decentralized exchange.

                    At the top of the Market page on the Hive Engine website there are buttons to both deposit and withdraw HIVE. Please do NOT transfer tokens manually, to ensure your deposits and withdrawals arrive in the right location.

                    Please note that there is a 1% fee on all HIVE deposits and withdrawals. This fee is charged for the service of creating and maintaining the HIVE-pegged token on the Hive Engine platform and will be used to fund future development of the platform and associated services.

                        To buy or sell Hive Engine tokens on the market, you can first find the token you wish to trade in the tokens or wallet page and click on the trade icon next to it (). This will take you to the market view for that specific token. If you would like to buy the token you will first need enough HIVEP tokens in your account to pay for them at the specified price. You can get HIVEP tokens by either selling other Hive Engine tokens for HIVEP on the market, or you can deposit HIVE and get an equal amount of HIVEP tokens in return using the "Deposit HIVE" button at the top of the market page.
                        <br><br>
                        When you are ready to place your trade, you can enter the price at which you would like to buy or sell the tokens and the amount you would like to buy or sell and then press the "Buy" or "Sell" button. You will then see a confirmation screen in which you can double check the details of your order and submit it. Once submitted, your order will appear in the "My Open Orders" section until it is either filled or cancelled.

                        While the market is fully decentralized and anyone can trade any token on the Hive Engine platform against HIVE at any time, the Hive Engine website itself is still owned and operated by a centralized entity and must abide by local laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where it is based. As a result certain tokens may not be listed on the market page of the Hive Engine website, though they may still be able to be traded on other Hive Engine based front ends. Additionally, token creators may request that their token not be listed on the Hive Engine website market page and we plan to honor those requests.
